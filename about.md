“Having children really changes your view on these things. We’re born, we live for a brief instant, and we die. It’s been happening for a long time. Technology is not changing it much.”   This is a comment that the late Steve Jobs made to convey his faith in focusiong on the important things and don't spend a short life in vain.   I don't think I've spend my life in vain. I try hard not to spend my life in vain after graduation. I hope that this time I can make a good opportunity with this American IT internship.



In addition to being a developer of mobile applications, I also enjoy spending time outside. In winter, I always go skiing with my friends from middle school or high school to roast meat passionately. Also, in summer, I go to jeju Island, where my friend's house is, and enjoy summer vacation by swimming and eating delicious food.

Also, since I was young, I have had a romance about motorcycles, so I have saved some money to buy one since I was an adult. Eventually, I succeeded in purchasing and took the time to do leisure activities by enjoying the surrounding scenery by riding a motorcycle once a week.
